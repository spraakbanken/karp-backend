# Karp backend

This is the backend of Karp, SBX:s tool for managing lexical data and other 
structured data.

The basic structure in Karp is a resource, which is a collection of entries.
Each resource may  be configured according to the format of the data and other needs.

The backend consists of two parts. The command-line interface (CLI), used to 
manage resources and the web API for modifying and querying the data.

There is also a frontend, contact SBX for more information.

## Installation

Follow the steps in [getting started](#getting-started).

## CLI

Use the CLI to create or modify resources, publish resources and do bulk editing.
To view the CLI documentation, use:

`karp-cli --help`

The resource configuration is documented [here](docs/resource-config.md).

There is also a tutorial describing [creation of a resource](docs/add-resource.md).

## Web API

The API documentation for the current version is available [here](https://ws.spraakbanken.gu.se/ws/karp/v7/).

### Editing

Using the API (with credentials) one can:
- add an entry to a resource
- modify existing entries
- delete an entry from a resource (discard, actual data is retained) 

All edits are stored, along with time and the editor. The history of an entry is
also available through the API.

### Searching

Searching is done with our [custom query language](https://ws.spraakbanken.gu.se/ws/karp/v7/#section/Query-DSL).

Searching supports sorting and pagination.

## Versions

This is the version 7 of Karp backend, [for the legacy version (v5)](https://github.com/spraakbanken/karp-backend-v5).

## Dependencies

We use [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) for storage and [Elasticsearch][es-download] for search.

## Development

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

A Makefile is provided to simplify tasks.

### Getting started

1. First clone this repo: `git clone` or `gh repo clone` (if using github-cli).

2. Install dependencies:

  `make dev` (or `make install-dev`)

3. Install MariaDB and create a database

4. Setup environment variables (can be placed in a `.env` file in the root and then **?** `poetry run` sets those):
   ```
   export DB_DATABASE=<name of database>
   export DB_USER=<database user>
   export DB_PASSWORD=<user's password>
   export DB_HOST=localhost
   export AUTH_JWT_PUBKEY_PATH=/path/to/pubkey
   ```
5. Activate the virtual environment by running: `poetry shell`
6. Run `karp-cli db up` to initialize database
7. Run `make serve` or `make serve-w-reload` to start development server

   or `poetry shell` and then `uvicorn --factory karp.karp_v6_api.main:create_app`

8. To setup Elasticsearch, [download][es-download] Elasticsearch 8.x and run the
   following commands from the `elasticsearch-8.XXX` directory:
   ```
   bin/elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-icu
   ```
   Then run `bin/elasticsearch -Expack.security.enabled=false` to start it.
9. Add environment variables

```
export ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=http://localhost:9200
```

## Create test resources

1. `poetry shell` and then:
2. `karp-cli resource create assets/testing/config/places.json`
3. `karp-cli entries add places assets/testing/data/places.jsonl`
4. Do the same for `municipalities`
5. `karp-cli resource publish places 1`
6. `karp-cli resource publish municipalities 1`

### Testing

The tests are organized in unit, integration and end-to-end tests.

#### Unit tests

These test should have no infrastructure dependencies and should run fast.

Run them by:

- From repo root:
  - `make test` (or `make unit-tests`)
  - `make unit-tests-w-coverage` or `make cov-report=xml unit-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make test-w-coverage tests/unit`
  - `make unit-tests-w-coverage` or `make cov_report=xml unit-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make all_tests="tests/unit" test-w-coverage`

#### Integration tests

These test have some infrastructure dependencies and should run slower.

Run them by:

- From repo root:
  - `make integration-tests`
  - `make integration-tests-w-coverage` or `make cov-report=xml integration-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make test-w-coverage tests/integration`
  - `make integration-tests-w-coverage` or `make cov_report=xml integration-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make all_tests=tests/integration test-w-coverage`

#### End-to-end tests

These test have all infrastructure dependencies and should run slowest.

Run them by:

- From repo root:
  - `make e2e-tests`
  - `make e2e-tests-w-coverage` or `make cov-report=xml e2e-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make test-w-coverage tests/e2e`
  - `make e2e-tests-w-coverage` or `make cov_report=xml e2e-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make all_tests=tests/e2e test-w-coverage`

#### All tests

These test have all infrastructure dependencies and should run slowest.

Run them by:

- From repo root:
  - `make all-tests`
  - `make test-w-coverage` or `make cov-report=xml test-w-coverage`
  - `make all-tests-w-coverage`
  - `make test-w-coverage` or `make cov_report=xml test-w-coverage`
  - `make all-tests-w-coverage`

### Linting and formatting

Linting and formatting is done by [`ruff`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/).

Run linter with `make lint`. Settings are in `ruff.toml`.

Run formatter with `make fmt`, check if formatting is needed `make check-fmt`.

Usual commands for `ruff` is:

- `ruff --fix <path>` tries to fix linting problems.
- `ruff --add-noqa <path>` add noqa:s (silence lint) to each line that needs

### Version handling

### Version handling

Update version in the following files:
- [`pyproj.toml`](pyproject.toml)
- [`karp.main.config`](karp/main/config.py)
