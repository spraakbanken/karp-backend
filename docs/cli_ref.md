# CLI reference

The CLI itself provides the documenation of the commands. Try:

`karp-cli --help`

On this level, help lists the available subcommands.

Each subcommand also has some help: `karp-cli resource --help`

And each concrete command also show it's parameters: `karp-cli resource create --help`

## Shell completion

It is possible to install auto-completion of commmands in your shell (but it is currently quite slow), use:

`karp-cli --install-completion/--show-completion`
